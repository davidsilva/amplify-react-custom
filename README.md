## Experiments with AWS Amplify Gen 2 and Custom Queries, Mutations, AppSync, Pipeline Resolvers, etc.

This repository is meant to accompany [this video](https://github.com/onyxdevtutorials/amplify-gen2-custom-data).

In this episode we take a little side-trip into the world of AppSync JavaScript resolvers and in particular pipeline resolvers. We look at how to implement custom types, queries and mutations in AWS Amplify Gen 2. We also look at how to enable logging in AppSync to help with debugging.
